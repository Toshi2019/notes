\chapter{Introduction}

The main purpose of these notes is to prove a
duality theorem for cohomology of quasi-coherent sheaves, 
with respect to a proper morphism of locally noetherian 
preschemes. 
Various such theorems are already known. 
Typical is the duality theorem for a non-singular complete 
curve $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, 
which says that
\begin{equation*}
    h^0(D)=h^1(K-D),
\end{equation*}
where $D$ is a divisor, $K$ is the canonical divisor, and
\begin{equation*}
    h^i(D)=\dim_K H^i(X,L(D))
\end{equation*}
for any i, and any divisor D. 
(See e.g. \cite[Ch.~II]{SerreGr} for a proof.)

Various attempts were made to generalize this theorem 
to varieties of higher dimension, 
and as Zariski points out in his report [20], 
his generalization of a lemma of 
Enriques-Severi [19] is equivalent to the statement that
